Different plants require different light spectrums. Natural sunlight provides the full spectrum of yellow through violet that plants need for photosynthesis. Red is best for encouraging flowers and vegetative growth and blue helps regulate strong foliage growth. Just as with color spectrums, different plants need varying degrees of light intensity. The wattage & how close the light is to the plant determine the intensity. Some plants need to be 10\u201d-12\u201d from the light, others can be 36\u201d away.

A fertilizer containing these elements in equal proportion is considered a balanced plant food. Nitrogen helps in photosynthesis and encourages the growth of leaves and stems. Potassium and phosphorus also help in photosynthesis and aid in root and flower development. Most fertilizers have trace elements of other minerals that are lacking in the soil but are necessary for good plant growth. Fertilizers have a high salt content. If a plant is not producing new leaves and doesn\u2019t absorb the fertilizer, salts build up in the soil.

Too much fertilizer is worse than not enough. Most plants prefer a water soluble plant food at 1/2 the recommended strength. Plants that are in bloom or dormant should not be fertilized. Houseplant food contains nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). A fertilizer containing these elements in equal proportion is considered a balanced plant food. Nitrogen helps in photosynthesis and encourages the growth of leaves and stems. Potassium and phosphorus also help in photosynthesis and aid in root and flower development. Most fertilizers have trace elements of other minerals that are lacking in the soil but are necessary for good plant growth. Fertilizers have a high salt content.

Too much fertilizer is worse than not enough. Most plants prefer a water soluble plant food at 1/2 the recommended strength. Plants that are in bloom or dormant should not be fertilized. Houseplant food contains nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). A fertilizer containing these elements in equal proportion is considered a balanced plant food. Nitrogen helps in photosynthesis and encourages the growth of leaves and stems. Potassium and phosphorus also help in photosynthesis and aid in root and flower development. Most fertilizers have trace elements of other minerals that are lacking in the soil but are necessary for good plant growth. Fertilizers have a high salt content.

Prevent Botrytis by quickly removing all dead or dying leaves and flowers that can serve as a breeding grounds. Keep water off of the leaves and provide good air circulation around plants. If a plant becomes infected with Gray Mold, trim off the diseased areas, remove any soil that has mold on it, and spray with a commercial fungicide.

Slow growing plants in low light require very little plant food. Too much fertilizer is worse than not enough. Most plants prefer a water soluble plant food at 1/2 the recommended strength.

A fertilizer containing these elements in equal proportion is considered a balanced plant food. Nitrogen helps in photosynthesis and encourages the growth of leaves and stems. Potassium and phosphorus also help in photosynthesis and aid in root and flower development. Most fertilizers have trace elements of other minerals that are lacking in the soil but are necessary for good plant growth. Fertilizers have a high salt content.

These lights attempt to provide a spectrum of light similar to what the sun provides. Orchids & African Violets can be encouraged to bloom all year & herbs and salad greens can be grown indoors. Different plants require different light spectrums. Natural sunlight provides the full spectrum of yellow through violet that plants need for photosynthesis. Red is best for encouraging flowers and vegetative growth and blue helps regulate strong foliage growth. Just as with color spectrums, different plants need varying degrees of light intensity. The wattage & how close the light is to the plant determine the intensity. Some plants need to be 10\u201d-12\u201d from the light, others can be 36\u201d away. Plants need a rest period, so lights shouldn't be left on all of the time. There are three main light categories: short-day plants need about 12 hours of light; day neutral plants need 8-12 hours; long day plants need 14-18 hours. Many types of grow lights are available: Fluorescent lights are the cheapest & produce 2-3 times more light than the incandescent. Full-spectrum fluorescent produce a balance of cool & warm light that mimics the sun. Metal halide lights emit an intense, bluish-white light & seem to be the most popular grow lights used today.
